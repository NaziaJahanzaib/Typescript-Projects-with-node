//Alien colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in game.  and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.


//Create a variable called alien_color
let alien_color :string = 'green';


//Write an if statement to test whether the alien's color is green, If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points:
if (alien_color === 'green') {
    console.log("Player Just earned 5 points!");
}

//write one version of this program that passes the if test another that fails.
alien_color = 'yellow';

//(The version that fails will have no output.)

    if (alien_color === 'green') {
    console.log("Player Just earned 5 points!"); 
}
